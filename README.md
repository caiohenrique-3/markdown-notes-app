## What I learned

In this Markdown Notes React application, I honed my ability to navigate and
work with an existing codebase. This experience allowed me to gain proficiency
in adding new features to an already existing project. Additionally, I
strengthened my skills in tasks like array manipulation, proficiently managing
npm packages, and effectively utilizing localStorage for data storage.
